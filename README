git-subhistory - Interchangeably merge in and split out subtree history

by Han <laughinghan@gmail.com>

INTRO

git-subhistory, like git-submodule and git-subtree, manages subprojects
(call one "Sub") in a superproject (call it "Main") git repo. Like
git-subtree but unlike git-submodule, git-subhistory is stateless, you
pass "Sub's" subdirectory (call it "path/to/sub/") as an argument to
git-subhistory but it's not specially marked in any way, "Sub's" files
are tracked directly by the "Main" repo like any other files, and no
other git tools know or care that "path/to/sub/" contains a subproject.

WAIT, HOW DOES THIS WORK?

Well, you know how you can `git log "path/to/sub/"` to see the history
of just stuff in "path/to/sub/"? `git-subhistory split` is like that but
creates a whole new commit history of just that stuff, rooted inside
"path/to/sub/". This new commit history of just "Sub" can be pushed to
its own repo and developed independently, or included in other projects.

Say that happens and commits are made on top of that new commit history.
Then `git-subhistory merge` merges those changes back into "Main's"
commit history by inverting `split`, creating new commits making those
same changes on top of the original "Main" commits.

EXAMPLE

Let's say we have history like so:

  $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --stat
  * c79da42 (HEAD, master) Add another Main thing
  |  another-Main-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 6285d3c Add another Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 81ac521 Add a Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/a-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * c242f3e Add a Main thing
     a-Main-thing | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

We can split out the commit history of just Sub in path/to/sub/:

  $ ../git-subhistory.sh split path/to/sub/ -B subproj
  Rewrite 6285d3c68b3eb5f0cd2cb8c376c0d83a0f2b7c0a (2/2)
  Ref 'refs/heads/subproj' was rewritten

  Split out history of path/to/sub/ to subproj (also SPLIT_HEAD)
  $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --stat --all
  * c79da42 (HEAD, master) Add another Main thing
  |  another-Main-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 6285d3c Add another Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 81ac521 Add a Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/a-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * c242f3e Add a Main thing
     a-Main-thing | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 13aa18a (subproj) Add another Sub thing
  |  another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 4970e20 Add a Sub thing
     a-Sub-thing | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

Notice 2 disconnected histories here, the untouched 'master' branch, and
this new 'subproj' branch, with the history of just the stuff inside
'path/to/sub/'. Say we push 'subproj' to a public repo for just Sub, and
implausibly, our code isn't perfect and bugfixes are contributed to the
public repo. Let's pull in the upstream bugfixes:

  $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --stat subproj
  * d535a7c (subproj) Fix Sub further
  |  fix-Sub-further | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * b7909ee Fix Sub somehow
  |  fix-Sub-somehow | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 13aa18a Add another Sub thing
  |  another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 4970e20 Add a Sub thing
     a-Sub-thing | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

Here's where the magic happens: we can easily merge these changes into
Main **using the "Add another Sub thing" commit as the merge base**:

  $ ../git-subhistory.sh merge path/to/sub/ subproj
  Rewrite 6285d3c68b3eb5f0cd2cb8c376c0d83a0f2b7c0a (2/2)
  Ref 'SPLIT_HEAD' was rewritten

  Split out history of path/to/sub/ to SPLIT_HEAD

  Rewrite d535a7c1c90b42d66eb0938172538aa5fc878460 (2/2)
  Ref 'SUBHISTORY_MERGE_HEAD' was rewritten

  Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
   path/to/sub/fix-Sub-further | 1 +
   path/to/sub/fix-Sub-somehow | 1 +
   2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
   create mode 100644 path/to/sub/fix-Sub-further
   create mode 100644 path/to/sub/fix-Sub-somehow
  $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --stat
  *   2626aba (HEAD, master) Merge subhistory branch 'subproj' under path/to/sub/
  |\
  | * ff9f142 Fix Sub further
  | |  path/to/sub/fix-Sub-futher | 1 +
  | |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  | * e2d4c00 Fix Sub somehow
  | |  path/to/sub/fix-Sub-somehow | 1 +
  | |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * | c79da42 Add another Main thing
  |/
  |    another-Main-thing | 1 +
  |    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 6285d3c Add another Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 81ac521 Add a Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/a-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * c242f3e Add a Main thing
     a-Main-thing | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

See that? The commits on 'subproj' that fixed Sub after adding
another-Sub-thing were effortlessly transmuted into commits that fix
Sub inside path/to/sub/ after adding path/to/sub/another-Sub-thing,
allowing them to merge cleanly like they clearly should, no commits
duplicated.

DESCRIPTION

git-subhistory split <subproj-path> [(-b | -B) <subproj-branch>]

  `git-subhistory split` literally just uses the --subdirectory-filter
  of git-filter-branch, which does pretty much the same thing as
  `git-subtree split`: it generates a completely new, synthetic commit
  graph of the history of just "Sub's" directory. Like the commit
  history shown by `git log --graph "path/to/sub/"`, it includes only
  commits that affected "path/to/sub/", but each commit is rewritten so
  its root tree is the "path/to/sub/" subtree.

git-subhistory merge <subproj-path> <subproj-branch>

  What git-subhistory intends to do better than git-subtree is merging,
  into "Main", commits to "Sub" made outside "Main", by inverting split:
  it looks through the commits on <subproj-branch> for synthetic commits
  that were generated by splitting out some ancestor of HEAD, and then
  on top of the original "Main" commits those synthetic commits were
  generated from, generates more synthetic commits that make the same
  change as the "Sub" commits but to "path/to/sub/" in "Main" instead.

Notes about...

toplevel:
  Unlike git-submodule and git-subtree, git-subhistory does NOT "need to
  [be run] from the toplevel of the working tree", run it wherever you
  damn well please, even inside "path/to/sub/" with . as <subproj-path>.

SPLIT_HEAD:
  All commands run `git-subhistory split` at some point, mutating
  SPLIT_HEAD to be HEAD split at <subproj-path>.

grafts/replacement refs:
  Synthetic commits are all created with git-filter-branch, which honors
  the info/grafts file and refs in refs/replaces/. Grafts and
  replacement refs will hence be permanently baked into the synthetic
  commit histories. Changing relevant ones will cause subsequent
  synthetic history to not match up at all.
  (Potential TODO: creating synthetic grafts and replacement refs for
   the synthetic history? But originals and synthetic grafts/replacement
   refs would have to be modified in sync.)

COMPARISON WITH GIT-SUBTREE

I actually think git-subtree was halfway there, it got splitting pretty
much right, but then did merging wrong and had to needlessly complicate
splitting to deal with the broken merging. In fact, I started out trying
to fork git-subtree, intending to add an alternative way to merge,
until I discovered that `git-subtree split` was now more complicated
than `git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter`.

If you went through the example above with equivalent git-subtree
commands, the history after splitting would be identical (right down to
the hashes--the complication is only when you've `git-subtree merge`-ed
before into the branch being split), but after merging, you'd get:

  $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --stat
  *   0584b9a (HEAD, master) Merge commit 'd535a7c1c90b42d66eb0938172538aa5fc878460'
  |\
  | * d535a7c (subproj) Fix Sub further
  | |  fix-Sub-further | 1 +
  | |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  | * b7909ee Fix Sub somehow
  | |  fix-Sub-somehow | 1 +
  | |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  | * 13aa18a Add another Sub thing
  | |  another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  | |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  | * 4970e20 Add a Sub thing
  |    a-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * c79da42 Add another Main thing
  |  another-Main-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 6285d3c Add another Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/another-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * 81ac521 Add a Sub thing
  |  path/to/sub/a-Sub-thing | 1 +
  |  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  * c242f3e Add a Main thing
     a-Main-thing | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

In this example, the commits adding path/to/sub/a-Sub-thing and
path/to/sub/another-Sub-thing to Main were split into commits adding
a-Sub-thing and another-Sub-thing to Sub just like you'd want.
`git-subhistory split` doesn't just serve the same purpose as
`git-subtree split`, it actually does almost exactly the same thing and
often generates identical commits with identical hashes, but is
implemented as a simple `filter-branch --subdirectory-filter`, whereas
git-subtree "manually" loops through history and calls git commit-tree.
I don't know why it does that, but conjecture that using filter-branch
it would be hard to deal with commits that are `merge -s subtree`-ed in
(see below), which are exactly where git-subhistory-generated commits
start diverging from git-subtree-generated commits.

You can see in the example that `git-subtree merge` does something
completely different from `git-subhistory merge`. `git-subtree merge`
actually does `merge --strategy subtree`, which is a fine and dandy
merge option that would let you include Sub in Main very similarly to
git-subhistory: in Main, you can `merge -s subtree` a commit from an
upstream Sub repo, and changes to Sub from there will be merged with
changes to path/to/sub/ in Main. Importantly, as far as git-merge is
concerned it's just some strategy for merging the trees of two commits,
so it normally creates a merge commit whose parents are commits from
each of Main and Sub (notice in the example that the subproject files
a-Sub-thing and another-Sub-thing are at different paths between the
parents of HEAD). If merging in upstream changes is all you need, this
is awesome: next `merge -s subtree`, the last `merge -s subtree`-ed in
commit will be the merge base, and Sub's commit history shows up in
Main's commit history.

What is not awesome is that if you commit changes to Sub in the Main
repo, split them out into synthetic commits that get merged into an
upstream Sub repo, and then `merge -s subtree` from upstream Sub back
into Main, the synthetic commits are totally different from the Main
commits that changed Sub, neither is a fast-forward of the other, they
won't be a merge base, and they will both show up in Main's commit
history, essentially duplicating all commits to Sub made in Main (notice
in the example, 2 ancestors of HEAD create and add a-Sub-thing and
another-Sub-thing :( ).

For this reason, most git-subtree tutorials I've seen actually recommend
using --squash when merging, which creates a synthetic commit combining
all the upstream changes to Sub since the last merge, which solves the
duplicate commit problem, but then, no upstream Sub commits are in
Main's history, Main commits are never a fast-forward of any upstream
Sub commits, and there will never be a merge-base. On projects I've
worked on where we wanted to both push and pull commits to and from an
upstream Sub repo (from and to a Main repo), we decided that was worse
than submodules and used submodules instead.
